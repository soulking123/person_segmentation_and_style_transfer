# person_segmentation_and_style_transfer
the model will return the segmented detected object, and then i also apply the styles transfer. so in the end the final result will be similar like a common segmentation model but instead of displaying the detected object ( segemented object) with color, it will now displayed by styles transfer ( the styles depends on the given image )
